# HiveCoRaffleScript

This simple Javascript puppeteer script will run a headless instance of Chrome and enter a desired Hive.co based raffle with random names and emails as many times as you want.

The script utilizes proxies and works with either IP or User:Pass authenticated proxies.

Modify the JS file where there are comments to input your info and raffle.

You will need Node and Puppeteer installed in order to run the script.
